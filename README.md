# APInFly

APInFly is a scaffolding utility for quickly generating a REST API straight from different SQL databases. The goal of the program is to allow an API to be spun up, customized, and run with just a few lines of code. The utility runs the API using the [Falcon](https://falcon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html "Falcon") ASGI framework on [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/ "uvicorn") ASGI, allowing multi-threading and scalability.

APInFly is still a work in progress at this time.
